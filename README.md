## Overview

This project focuses on the design and development of an instructional program to enhance managerial skills in guiding team members' career development, specifically through the effective implementation of **Blue Box Values** at American Express. The course aims to address the performance gap where managers struggle to identify appropriate opportunities for career growth and provide direction to help team members excel.

## Project Details

- **Performance Gap:** Managers at American Express struggle with guiding their team members in career development, especially in the implementation of Blue Box Values.
- **Goal:** Create a learning experience that enables managers to better select career development opportunities and provide actionable guidance using Blue Box Values.

## Learning Objectives

### **Terminal Learning Objective (TLO):**
By the end of the course, managers will be able to guide their team members' career development by implementing Blue Box Values, selecting the most appropriate career development opportunities, and offering clear, actionable direction.

### **Enabling Learning Objectives (ELOs):**
1. **ELO 1**: Explain the Blue Box Values and their role in career development.
2. **ELO 2**: Identify various career development opportunities for team members.
3. **ELO 3**: Select the most appropriate area of opportunity for each team member.
4. **ELO 4**: Improve the implementation of Blue Box Values to facilitate team member career development.

## Learning Modalities

To meet the diverse learning preferences of the participants, the following modalities will be used:
- **Visual and Auditory Learning**: The content will include videos, infographics, and audio elements to help enhance retention and recall.
- **Micro-Learning**: The course will be broken into manageable, bite-sized segments to ensure effective learning and retention.
- **Interactive Scenarios**: Learners will engage with branching decision-making scenarios to apply their knowledge in realistic settings.
- **Multimedia**: A combination of photographs, icons, graphs, and videos will be used to reinforce key concepts and enhance engagement.

## Bloom‚Äôs Taxonomy Levels

The course design incorporates multiple levels from Bloom‚Äôs Taxonomy to ensure comprehensive learning:
1. **Remembering**: Recall the Blue Box Values and their importance in career development.
2. **Understanding**: Explain how the Blue Box Values contribute to career development.
3. **Applying**: Apply knowledge to identify and select appropriate career development opportunities.
4. **Analyzing**: Analyze scenarios to determine the best course of action for a team member‚Äôs career development.

## Evaluation Strategy

### **Formative Evaluation:**
- **Quizzes and Interactive Exercises**: Embedded throughout the course, these assessments will help ensure learners understand and retain the key concepts.
- **Scenario-Based Activities**: Learners will complete practical, decision-making tasks and receive immediate feedback on their choices.

### **Summative Evaluation:**
- **Capstone Project**: Learners will develop a personalized career development plan for one of their team members, integrating the Blue Box Values.
- **Post-Course Survey**: A feedback survey will be provided to measure learners' confidence and effectiveness in implementing Blue Box Values.

## Course Design Outline

- **Learning Management System (LMS):** The course will be hosted on **Moodle**, a robust and flexible LMS that supports multimedia, quizzes, and interactive elements. Moodle is chosen for its tracking capabilities and ability to manage content effectively.
  
- **Engaging Learner Interactions:**
  - **Branching Scenarios**: Learners will engage in decision-making exercises, with the ability to make choices and receive immediate feedback.
  - **Gamification**: Points and badges will be awarded for completing sections and achieving milestones, encouraging learners to stay engaged.
  
- **Multimedia Elements:**
  - Infographics and videos will be used to present complex concepts in an easily digestible format.
  - Photographs and icons will illustrate key points and keep the content visually stimulating.

- **Navigation:**
  - The course will include a simple, user-friendly interface with clear progress indicators (e.g., progress bar).
  - Learners can easily move between content sections using ‚ÄúNext‚Äù and ‚ÄúBack‚Äù buttons.
  - Interactive quizzes and branching scenarios will be included to actively engage learners.
